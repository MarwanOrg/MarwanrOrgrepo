        GENEX Assistant is powerful software for testing radio data that is also used to analyze and
        process radio network air interface data. It provides a wide range of visualization tools that make
        data interpretation more intuitive and efficient. GENEX Assistant can help network planning and
        network optimization engineering to understand and identify network performance and reliability
        issues by offering clear insights into multiple network parameters. This software is used for
        reporting and analyzing the driving test results called logfile, which can be run directly in the
        software based on the previously created route. It supports various data formats and technologies,
        allowing seamless comparison across different metrics. Additionally, GENEX Assistant enables
        users to customize reports and extract key performance indicators (KPIs), making it a valuable tool
        for troubleshooting and informed decision-making. The software provides detailed information
        from the sites covered during the drive test process, contributing significantly to both the planning
        and optimization phases.
